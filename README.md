# ArkHackathonToronto
This program is an attempt at improving the job match-making process. We will attempt to use machine learning to assign weights to attributes of Companies, Students, and Universities, thereby allowing us to assign scores to these items. These weights will then be placed on a blockchain, so as to provide transparecy in regards to weights without violating the privacy of the individuals that provide data. Placing the weights on blockchain will also provide security towards tampering and manipulation fo the weights. An attempt will be made to introduce fit between students and companies, and student quality improvement for universities. Natural Language processing will be used to assess certian portions of the score, such as descriptions on company evaluation websites and resume materials, such as work experience.
